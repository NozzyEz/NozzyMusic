# NozzyMusic
Small React music player app that I have created, which imports tracks from ChillHop and plays them back to you.

### App Features
* 10 handpicked tracks from ChillHop
* Play, Pause, Stop
* Playlist shelf
* Shuffle, repeat one, and repeat all
* Dark mode
* Subtle animations when playing

### info
App was created using react, it is a single page application, it does not use Redux.

Styling is done with SCSS
